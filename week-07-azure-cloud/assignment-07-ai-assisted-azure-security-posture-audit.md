# Assignment 7 — AI-Assisted Azure Security Posture Audit

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash script that audits the Azure resources you deployed earlier this week — a virtual machine, a three-tier network with a Load Balancer, a Storage Account, and an Azure Database for MySQL server — for common security misconfigurations. You will connect that script to Claude Code as a reusable `/azure-audit` skill that explains findings and recommends a fix without ever running it, then fix one real finding yourself and prove the fix with a second audit run. This is the same read-only-evidence-then-human-fixes discipline from Week 3, now applied to Azure with the `az` CLI instead of Linux commands — and the cloud-agnostic counterpart to the AWS audit you built in Week 6.

---

# Task 1 — Confirm Your Resources and Create the Workspace

## Goal

Confirm your Azure CLI is authenticated and can see the VM, network, storage account, and MySQL server you built this week, then set up a workspace folder for the audit.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — `az account show` and `az vm list -d -o table` confirming your subscription and running VM (subscription ID partially blurred)

---

# Task 2 — Create Project Context and Safety Rules in CLAUDE.md

## Goal

Create a `CLAUDE.md` for this workspace that tells Claude what the audit covers and the safety rules it must follow: never run a mutating `az` command, never claim a finding without report evidence, and always let the human review and run any remediation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `CLAUDE.md` open in your editor showing the project overview, audit workflow, and safety rules

# Task 3 — Use Agentic AI to Plan the Audit Before Writing the Script

## Goal

Ask Claude Code to read `CLAUDE.md` and propose a read-only, four-check audit plan (NSG rules open to `0.0.0.0/0` on port 22 or 3389, storage account public blob access, VM disk encryption status, and Azure Database for MySQL public network access) — without creating or editing any file yet.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Claude Code showing the four-check plan, with no files created or modified

---

# Task 4 — Build the Azure Audit Bash Script

## Goal

Write a Bash script that runs the four checks from Task 3 using read-only `az` commands, writes a PASS/WARN/FAIL report with your Full Name, and exits with a different code for a healthy, warning, or failing result. Validate it with `bash -n` and make it executable.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Your script open in your editor, showing the check functions and the `az` commands they call

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Output of `bash -n` (no syntax errors) and `ls -l` showing the script is executable

![Screenshot](screenshots/Assignment7.Task4.ss5.png)

---

# Task 5 — Run the Script and Review the Baseline Report

## Goal

Run the script against your live resources and read the report honestly, even if it shows a real finding — do not fix anything yet.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Script output showing your Full Name and all four checks with a PASS, WARN, or FAIL result

![Screenshot](screenshots/Assignment7.Task5.ss6.png)

---

# Task 6 — Create and Run the /azure-audit Skill

## Goal

Create a Claude Code skill restricted to read-only tools (no `Write`) that runs your script, reads the report, and explains every finding with the risk of leaving it unresolved — without ever running a remediation command itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Your skill file's frontmatter showing `allowed-tools` without `Write`

---

#### Screenshot 8 — `/azure-audit` output showing the baseline findings and Claude's explanation

---

# Task 7 — Fix a Real Finding and Re-Verify

## Goal

Pick one WARN or FAIL finding (or deliberately open an NSG rule to port 22 from `0.0.0.0/0` if your baseline was already clean), save that failing report, run the remediation command yourself — scoped to your own IP, not left open — and confirm the second audit run shows it resolved.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Saved report showing the original finding before the fix

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Terminal output of the remediation command you ran yourself

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Second `/azure-audit` run (or report) showing the finding resolved

### Notes

Compare this assignment to the AWS audit you built in Week 6: which finding categories map to each other across the two clouds, and what stayed exactly the same about the workflow even though the `az`/`aws` commands are completely different?

The AWS audit from Week 6 and this Azure audit use the same security-audit workflow, even though the CLI commands are different.

Finding categories that map across both clouds:

Network security: AWS checked Security Groups for unrestricted SSH/MySQL access; Azure checks Network Security Groups for unrestricted inbound SSH/RDP access.
Storage security: AWS checked S3 public-access settings; Azure checks whether the Storage Account allows public blob access.
Disk encryption: AWS checked EBS volume encryption; Azure checks VM OS-disk encryption status.
Database exposure: AWS checked whether the RDS database was publicly accessible; Azure checks whether the Azure Database for MySQL server has public network access enabled.

What stayed exactly the same:

The workflow remained Gather → Analyze → Remediate → Verify. In both assignments, the audit first uses read-only cloud CLI commands to collect evidence, produces a report with PASS/WARN/FAIL results, uses Agentic AI to analyze the evidence and recommend a safe remediation, and then requires the human to review and execute the remediation. A second audit is then performed to verify that the finding was resolved.

The main difference is simply the cloud provider and CLI: AWS uses aws commands, while Azure uses az commands. The security principles, evidence-based reporting, least-privilege approach, and human-controlled remediation workflow remain the same.
