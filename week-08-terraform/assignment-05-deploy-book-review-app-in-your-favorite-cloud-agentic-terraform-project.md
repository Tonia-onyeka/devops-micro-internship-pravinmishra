# Task 9 — Answer the Reflection Questions

## Goal

Reflect on the architecture, Terraform implementation, and Agentic AI workflow. Answer each question briefly in your own words.

## Architecture

### 1. Why did you separate the Web, Application, and Database tiers?

I separated the Web, Application, and Database tiers to improve security, scalability, and maintainability. Each tier has a specific responsibility, so changes or problems in one layer do not directly affect the others.

### 2. Why is the Application Tier private?

The Application Tier is private so users cannot access the application servers directly from the internet. Only the Web Tier can communicate with the Application Tier, which reduces the attack surface and improves security

### 3. Why is MySQL private?

MySQL is private because the database should not be directly accessible from the internet. Only the Application Tier should be allowed to connect to the database through the required database port.

### 4. Why are multiple Availability Zones used?

I used multiple Availability Zones to improve availability and fault tolerance. If one Availability Zone experiences a failure, resources in another Availability Zone can continue serving the application.

### 5. What is the difference between Multi-AZ/high availability and a read replica?

Multi-AZ is mainly for high availability and failover. A standby database can take over when the primary fails. A read replica is mainly used to handle read traffic and improve read performance. A read replica is not the same as a high-availability standby.

## Terraform

### 6. How did you divide your Terraform into modules?

I divided the Terraform configuration into reusable modules based on the architecture. The main modules include Network, Security, Load Balancer, Compute, and Database. This keeps the configuration organized and easier to maintain.

### 7. How do the modules communicate through variables and outputs?

Modules receive information through input variables and expose important resources through outputs. For example, the Network module outputs subnet and VPC information that other modules can use without hard-coding those values.

### 8. What did you specifically check in `terraform plan`?

I checked that Terraform was creating the expected resources and that there were no unexpected changes or destructive actions. I also reviewed networking, security groups, subnets, load balancers, EC2 resources, and database configuration before applying the plan.

## Agentic AI

### 9. What was the purpose of `CLAUDE.md`?

`CLAUDE.md` provided Claude with the project's instructions, architecture requirements, security rules, workflow, and restrictions. It helped keep Claude's work aligned with the project's goals and prevented unsafe actions.

### 10. What work did the Terraform Engineer subagent perform?

The Terraform Engineer subagent helped design and review the Terraform infrastructure. It worked through the required architecture, modules, networking, security, and AWS resources while following the project instructions.

### 11. What did the Architecture and Security Reviewer identify?

The Architecture and Security Reviewer checked the design for security and architectural weaknesses. It helped identify areas such as network exposure, security-group rules, private resources, access controls, and whether the architecture followed the required three-tier design.

### 12. Why did you use Terraform MCP instead of relying only on Claude's existing Terraform knowledge?

I used Terraform MCP to give Claude access to more reliable and current Terraform-related information and tools. This reduced the risk of relying only on its existing knowledge and helped validate Terraform resources and configurations against available documentation.

### 13. What was the purpose of your validation hooks?

The validation hooks acted as guardrails around the Agentic AI workflow. They helped check commands and Terraform-related actions before or after execution, preventing unsafe operations and providing logging or validation where necessary.

### 14. Describe one real issue Claude helped you troubleshoot.

One real issue was troubleshooting the application deployment when the Application Load Balancer target health was not healthy. Claude helped me investigate the target group, instance health, application port, and backend configuration to identify where the communication problem was occurring.

### 15. Describe one recommendation you reviewed, modified, or rejected instead of accepting blindly.

One recommendation I reviewed was related to infrastructure changes and deployment actions. Instead of allowing Claude to apply or destroy resources automatically, I followed the project guardrails and reviewed the Terraform plan myself before making changes. This helped me remain in control of potentially costly or destructive operations.
