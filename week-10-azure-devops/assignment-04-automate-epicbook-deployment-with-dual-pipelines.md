# Assignment 4 — Automate EpicBook Deployment with Dual Pipelines

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will automate the EpicBook infrastructure and application deployment on Microsoft Azure using two repositories and two Azure DevOps pipelines. Terraform will provision the infrastructure, and Ansible will configure the servers, connect EpicBook to Azure Database for MySQL, and deploy the application through Nginx.

---

# Task 0 — Verify Accounts, Tools, and Pipeline Capacity

## Goal

Confirm that the required accounts, tools, pipeline agent, SSH key pair, and Terraform remote-state location are ready.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 1 — Prepare the Two Repositories

## Goal

Create separate Infrastructure and Application Repositories for the EpicBook deployment.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 2 — Configure Azure DevOps Connections, Secure Files, and Secrets

## Goal

Configure controlled pipeline access to GitHub, Microsoft Azure, the virtual machines, and Azure Database for MySQL.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

> Do not expose the Azure Client Secret, SSH private key, MySQL password, access token, subscription ID, or another sensitive value.

---

# Task 3 — Author the Terraform Infrastructure Configuration

## Goal

Define the complete EpicBook Azure infrastructure using Terraform and an Azure Storage remote backend.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 4 — Author and Run the Infrastructure Pipeline

## Goal

Validate, plan, approve, and apply the Terraform configuration through the Infrastructure Pipeline.

## Evidence

Add a screenshot of the Infrastructure Pipeline run showing:

* Successful `terraform apply` completion
* `app_public_ip`
* `backend_ansible_host`
* `backend_private_ip`
* `mysql_fqdn`

---

### Screenshot 2 — Provisioned Azure Resources

Add a screenshot of the Azure Portal Resource Group overview showing:

* Virtual Network and related networking resources
* Frontend VM
* Backend VM
* Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server
* Related EpicBook resources

> Hide sensitive IDs, credentials, and database details.

---

# Task 5 — Complete the Manual Terraform-to-Ansible Handoff

## Goal

Transfer the required non-sensitive Terraform outputs to the Application Repository for use by Ansible.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 6 — Author the Ansible Application Configuration

## Goal

Create idempotent Ansible automation that configures the frontend and backend VMs, prepares the database, configures Nginx, and deploys EpicBook.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 7 — Author and Run the Application Pipeline

## Goal

Run the Application Pipeline to configure the VMs, deploy EpicBook, and verify the application environment.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 3 — Successful Application Pipeline

Add a screenshot of the Application Pipeline run summary showing all required stages or jobs succeeded.

### Screenshot 4 — Successful Ansible Play Recap

Add a screenshot of the Application Pipeline log showing:

* Ansible play recap
* Successful configuration or verification
* Zero failed hosts
* Zero unreachable hosts

> Do not expose the SSH private key, MySQL password, Client Secret, or complete database connection string.

---

# Task 8 — Verify the Complete EpicBook Workflow

## Goal

Verify that the frontend, backend, and Azure Database for MySQL work together correctly.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 5 — Running EpicBook Application

Add a browser screenshot showing:

* Running EpicBook application
* Frontend public IP address in the browser address bar
* Your Full Name
* Deployment date

The screenshot may show a product, cart, or successful order view.

# Two-Repository Model

Write a short explanation of why separate Infrastructure and Application Repositories were used.

Separate Infrastructure and Application Repositories were used to maintain a clear separation of responsibilities.

The Infrastructure Repository contains Terraform and infrastructure-related configuration used to provision and manage cloud resources. The Application Repository contains the application code, deployment configuration, Ansible files, and CI/CD workflow used to build and deploy the application.

This separation reduces the risk of application changes accidentally modifying infrastructure and makes it easier to manage infrastructure and application lifecycles independently. It also supports clearer access control, review, and troubleshooting because each repository has a defined purpose.

---

# Manual Terraform-to-Ansible Handoff

Write a short explanation of how the following non-sensitive Terraform outputs were transferred to the Application Repository:

* `app_public_ip`
* `backend_ansible_host`
* `backend_private_ip`
* `mysql_fqdn`

The required non-sensitive Terraform outputs were obtained from the Infrastructure Repository after the infrastructure was provisioned.

The following values were then manually transferred to the appropriate configuration files in the Application Repository:

app_public_ip — used to identify the public endpoint or application host.
backend_ansible_host — used as the Ansible inventory host for the backend server.
backend_private_ip — used where the backend's private network address was required.
mysql_fqdn — used to provide the backend application with the MySQL database hostname.

Only the required non-sensitive outputs were transferred. Secrets such as database passwords, private keys, tokens, and credentials were not copied into the Application Repository.

This manual handoff creates a controlled boundary between infrastructure provisioning and application deployment while allowing Ansible and the application pipeline to use the infrastructure information they require.
