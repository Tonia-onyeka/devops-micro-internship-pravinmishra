# Assignment 5 — Sharing the Docker Container on Docker Hub

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will publish a Dockerized React application to Docker Hub, remove the local image tags, pull the image again from Docker Hub, and run it to verify that it can be downloaded and deployed from a container registry.

---

# Task 1 — Publish a Docker Image to Docker Hub

## Goal

Tag a locally built React image, publish it to Docker Hub, remove the local copy, pull it again from Docker Hub, and run it successfully.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Public Docker Hub Repository

Add a screenshot of Docker Hub showing your newly created public repository:

```text
my-react-app
```

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Successful Docker Login

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```text
Login Succeeded
```

Ensure that your full name is visible and that no password, Personal Access Token, or device code is exposed.

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Correctly Tagged Image

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker image ls <YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/my-react-app
```

The output must show the `latest` tag.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Successful Docker Push

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing successful completion of:

```bash
docker push <YOUR_DOCKERHUB_USERNAME>/my-react-app:latest
```

The output must include a pushed status or image digest.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Published `latest` Tag in Docker Hub

Add a screenshot of your Docker Hub repository showing the uploaded `latest` image tag.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Local Image Removed and Pulled Again

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

- The targeted local image tags removed
- Successful `docker pull` output
- `docker image ls` showing the pulled image

---

#### Screenshot 7 — Running Pulled Image

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker ps
```

The output must show the running `react-container` with:

```text
0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
```

---

#### Screenshot 8 — React Application in Browser

Add a browser screenshot showing the React application at:

```text
http://16.171.9.51/
```

Ensure that the VM public IP is visible in the address bar. Add your full name as a clear caption directly below the screenshot.

# Registry and Image Tagging Notes

Write a short explanation covering:

- Why image tagging is required before pushing to Docker Hub
- Why a container registry is useful in DevOps workflows
- Why production deployments should use versioned image tags instead of relying only on `latest`

Image tagging is required before pushing an image to Docker Hub because the tag identifies the image repository and version, making it possible to store, retrieve, and deploy the correct image.

A container registry is useful in DevOps workflows because it provides a central location to store, share, and distribute container images between development, testing, and production environments. This supports consistent and repeatable deployments.

For production deployments, versioned image tags such as `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1`, or a Git commit tag are preferred over relying only on `latest`. Versioned tags provide a specific, traceable image reference and make rollbacks and release management more predictable.
